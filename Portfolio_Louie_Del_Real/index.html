    <p> This Web Portfolio includes examples of my work in Mr. Lanus' Web Design
    class. It also includes my reflections (below) on what I learned in each
    unit of the course.</p>

  <h2>Unit 1: HTML</h2>
<ul>
  <p><strong><li>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts)
     in this unit? What do you think that they mean?</strong></p>
     <p> Body,doctype, main, h1,h aref=””, and many more.
        They are used to create links, different fonts, add text, create the
        skeleton, many and many different possibilities, and many other different
        tags, those are just a few that I listed.</li></p>

  <p><strong><li>What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in
    this unit of study?</strong></p>
    <p>I learned how colors play an important part in the way a website can
      turn out, and how to use tags like p, h1, main, and many more.</li></p>

  <p><strong><li>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work? </strong></p>
  <p>I've learned about how to use tags, and how they work and I know how to
     start a website from scratch.</li></p>

 <p><strong><li>In what ways do you think you need to improve?</strong></p>
 <p>I need to be more patient when it comes to web design, because this class
    requires a lot of patience.</li></p>

<p><strong><li>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this
   piece? How did you solve them?</strong></p>
   <p>It's not really a problem it's more of a bad habit, I would forgot to
     add the end dash on almost every end tag.</li></p>

<p><strong><li>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or
  the finished product?</strong></p>
  <p>I really like the finished product because it looks like Mr. Lanus’, and
    that's the look I was going for.</li></p>

<p><strong><li>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this
  piece?</strong></p>
<p> Nothing, I think my piece is beautiful, I would say “this piece is
  beautiful.”</li></p>
</ul>
